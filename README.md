# odd

Odd is a peculiar little software renderer written in Haxe that aims to be platform agnostic.

The idea is to define the rendering process in a cross-platform way, and have it accessible to platform-specific rendering contexts.

**Please note that Odd is still under development!**

## Instructions

1. Get [Haxe](http://haxe.org/download/). Odd was developed with 3.3.0-rc1, but any 3.2.x version is likely to work as well.
2. Get odd: `haxelib git odd https://github.com/dstrekelj/odd.git`.
3. Get one (or several!) Odd targets from `odd-target-*` repositories.
4. Try the samples in the `odd-samples` repository.

## Documentation

I have tried to keep the sources well documented, but not everything can fit into a couple of comment lines.

Please refer to the repository wiki for more complete documentation.
